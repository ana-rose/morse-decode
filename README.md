# MVP:

1. Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code.
2. Create JS functions that would allow the user to translate their English text into Morse Code or Morse Code into English text.
3. Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters).

HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript
